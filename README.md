Building static site with Jekyll and Github trial 

This is really a random link jumping to : http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/

So right now I am just following the instructions on the site

If you are looking for more information, i saw the guide from here : https://jekyllrb.com/docs/resources/

I am also new to coding so this is kind of fun.
